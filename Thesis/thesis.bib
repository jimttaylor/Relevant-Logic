abstract = {The main problem investigated is the adequacy of constant domain relational world semantics for quantified relevant logics. The problem is solved, though in a disagreeably circuitous way, for many weaker relevant logics, and an outline of how the solution may be extended to stronger logics such as RQ is given. Alternative necessity and intensional-conjunction style rules for the evaluation of quantifiers are studied and shown to simply force the main problems above with the usual (extensional conjunction style) quantifier - rule to reappear, unmitigated, at alternative outlets. Finally some philosophical problems allegedly engendered by constant domain world semantics are examined briefly: it is argued that the “problems” are no problems.}

abstract="In the early seventies, several logicians developed a semantics for propositional systems of relevance logic. The essential ingredients of this semantics were a privileged point o, an `accessibility' relation R and a special operator * for evaluating negation. Under the truth- conditions of the semantics, each formula A(Pl,{\ldots},Pn) could be seen as expressing a first order condition A+(pl,{\ldots},pn, o, R,*) on sets p1,{\ldots},pn and o, R, *, while each formula-scheme could be regarded as expressing the second-order condition ∀p1,{\ldots},∀pn A+(p1,{\ldots},pn, o, R, *). It could then be shown that many standard systems of propositional relevance logic were complete in the sense that their theorems were just those formulas true in all models whose components o, R and * conformed to the second-order conditions expressed by the axioms of the system.",

 abstract = {The implicational fragment of the logic of relevant implication, R→ is known to be decidable. We show that the implicational fragment of the logic of ticket entailment, T→ is decidable. Our proof is based on the consecution calculus that we introduced specifically to solve this 50-year old open problem. We reduce the decidability problem of T→ to the decidability problem of R→ The decidability of T→ is equivalent to the decidability of the inhabitation problem of implicational types by combinators over the base {B, B', I, W}.},
